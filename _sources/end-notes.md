#### Tangential Products
##### Reacton
React is now available in ipywidgets thanks to Reacton

##### py-react
py-react supports running Python in the browser via Pyodide. That being said, it does not appear to be aspiring to be a web application toolkit like other python-in-the-browser products (skulpt, brython, pyscript). Thus py-react is listed here in the tangential section. You may try it out here.

## Compelling Non-Python Products
