## Reacton – A pure Python port of React for ipywidgets
 ipywidgets is a library for writing interactive widgets in the Jupyter notebook.

Reacton is a pure Python library, that implements a similar API as ReactJS. Instead of rendering to the DOM, it renders to ipywidgets. The ipywidget library is then responsible for rendering in the front end (which could use ReactJS, Vue, or even jQuery).
