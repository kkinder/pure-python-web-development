# Class Defunct: defunct products
This section keeps track of products that are no longer maintained and may not address modern web application development concern.

## Datapane


[Datapane](https://docs.datapane.com) can be embedded in Flask or Django.

I'd be curious to see how it compares with [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org)

[Datapane - Build internal data products in 100% Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/125lyru/datapane_build_internal_data_products_in_100/)




## Dashborg
It may be a bit harsh to classify Dashborg as defunct. But the slack invite link is not working and the repos do not have recent commit. in fact, the main dashborg product is not FOSS, only the back-end SDKs are. The userbase appears small and there are no documented real-world use cases.

https://www.dashborg.net/ is unique. You could call it a more sane approach to the nightmare that Angular is. It allows one to create full applications but using a “live” version of HTML that dynamically self-populates using either Go or Python back-ends.

It is interesting, but it works backwards from the way I think: I would rather have a computer program generate HTML/JS/CSS rather than have my turing-complete language limited by what I can stick into HTML.

So I would say it would not interest me much in the same way that Angular does not – the less powerful language is orchestrating the use of a more powerful language.

Other past tools in this vein are OpenLaszlo. A current popular tool like this is HTMX.

## Muntjac
[Muntjac](https://github.com/rwl/muntjac) is an implementation of Vaadin for Python. Vaadin is an enterprise level Java web app framework with a large array of modern clean javascript widgets.

While [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com) abstracted away Javascript through Java, Muntjac did the same for Python in an impressive way.

## Timothy Crosley Products
### Webbot
https://github.com/timothycrosley/WebBot is

a collection of

several tools that enables building Python web applications

the same way native ones are built.

As a result, the WebBot framework encourages reuse,

concise code, rapid development, and happy developers.

## Jigna
[Jigna](https://github.com/enthought/jigna) showed great promise in it’s EuroPython 2014 talk. Being based on Enthought Traits and supported by Enthought are also feathers in its cap. However, the source code repo has seen no action for 3 years now, landing it in the defunct category.

## Jiphy
https://github.com/timothycrosley/jiphy is a nearly-defunct transpiler.

## TheDOM
https://github.com/timothycrosley/thedom is for generating HTML and JS

## AnPyLar
https://www.anpylar.com/ has seen no updates since 2018.

## PyJS (formerly PyJamas)
http://pyjs.org/ used to be called PyJamas but that name has been reserved for something altogether different now.
