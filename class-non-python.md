# Class Non-Python: Compelling metalanguages for web development outside of Python

## UrWeb
https://github.com/urweb/urweb is a single, strongly-typed language that compiles into a single binary that can execute SQL and Javascript (and of course render HTML/CSS).

## Vaadin
https://vaadin.com/ is a java-based product with tons of widgets that allows a Java developer to have all the interactivity with none of the headache of dealing with Javascript.

## HTMX
Many people who wish to remain in Django/Flask land [opt for HTMX](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926029) to give them the power of Javascript.

Through [HTMX](https://htmx.org), a web framework has access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML, through [attributes](https://htmx.org/reference/#attributes).

[PyHAT](https://github.com/PyHAT-stack/awesome-python-htmx) - collects resources on building websites using
Python, HTMX and Tailwind-CSS.

## Hyperscript (from the same people as HTMX)

Both HTMX and [Hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org) were created by [Big sky software](https://bigsky.software) and their combination is [apparently becoming popular with Djangoists](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/13ccenx/comment/jjfmijq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
