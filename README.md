By developing web apps entirely in Python, Python serves as a metalanguage generating the target languages of CSS/HTML/JS. This greatly simplifies and abstracts web application development. Prior to the web, graphical applications were largely developed in just a single language. And text applications are still this way. Web application has gone through some phases, that [I have discussed elsewhere](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTML::Seamstress#A-BRIEF-HISTORY-of-Dynamic-HTML-Generation-(Templating)):
1. server side includes
2. CGI scripts
3. Java applets
4. client-server partial page reloaded apps developed with a back-end and front-end

Stage 4 is where we are. But stage 3 was a more unified approach to GUI development, very similar to the way X-windows and C/TCL/Smalltalk were used to develop GUI apps prior to the web.
