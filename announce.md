# The Pure Python Web Framework Survey

Currently the guide divides pure python web frameworks into classes, with [Class A](https://metaperl.github.io/pure-python-web-development/class-a.html) being the most rigorous class to be admitted to. Only frameworks  meeting [4 hard criteria and perhaps 1 soft criteria](https://metaperl.github.io/pure-python-web-development/practical-guide.html#requirements-of-a-class-a-system) qualify.

The use of classes is not without drawbacks. If your needs are not for a world-class industrial-strength pure python solution, then you have to wade
through the other classes to find a less ambitious but perhaps quite acceptable product. There are numerous [Class B solutions](https://metaperl.github.io/pure-python-web-development/class-b.html) that fit well to certain domains (e.g. machine learning and visualization) and are completely acceptable for certain cases. And they often dont have as much boilerplate to dig through. They make simple things simple, but may make complex things (e.g. A and A) impossible. In fact, the most popular pure Python web framework is Class B (Streamlit). But [by no means is it the best](https://metaperl.github.io/pure-python-web-development/end-notes.html#let-s-talk-streamlit).

Class Other is also quite useful. I also encouage you to peruse the ever-growing collection of [TODOMVC examples](https://metaperl.github.io/pure-python-web-development/todomvc.html) to quickly compare the various offerings
