Currently the guide divides pure python web frameworks into classes, with [Class A](https://metaperl.github.io/pure-python-web-development/class-a.html) being the most rigorous class to be admitted to. Only frameworks  meeting [4 hard criteria and perhaps 1 soft criteria](https://metaperl.github.io/pure-python-web-development/practical-guide.html#requirements-of-a-class-a-system) qualify.

That being said, there are numerous [Class B solutions](https://metaperl.github.io/pure-python-web-development/class-b.html) that fit well to certain domains (e.g. machine learning and visualization) and are completely acceptable for certain cases. And they often dont have as much boilerplate to dig through. They make simple things simple, but may make complex things (e.g. A and A) impossible. In fact, the most popular pure Python web framework is Class B (Streamlit). But [by no means is it the best](https://metaperl.github.io/pure-python-web-development/end-notes.html#let-s-talk-streamlit).
