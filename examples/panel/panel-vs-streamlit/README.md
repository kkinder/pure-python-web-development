# Panel vs Streamlit

Marc Skov Madsen, maintainer of [Awesome Panel](https://awesome-panel.org/) made a compelling statement:

> Panel can do everything that Streamlit can do but Streamlit **cannot** do everything that Panel can do

It is this strong statement that we wish to put to the test in this folder. Since examples of Streamlit come by 
reddit Python quite often, we can simply rewrite them in panel as they come across.
